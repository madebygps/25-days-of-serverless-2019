# Challenge 6: Durable functions

[Description of challenge](https://25daysofserverless.com/calendar/6)

Build a chat integration for your favorite chat service (e.g. Discord or Slack) that lets you schedule tasks using natural language (e.g. /schedule volunteer at the senior citizens' center tomorrow at 11:00). You should be able to get a confirmation that your event has been scheduled, and then get a notification at the correct time.
